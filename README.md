# NGSI-LD API introduction and data models

## What this repository contains?

This repository contains:
- A [quick guide](API_Quick_Guide.md) to get started using the EGM's context broker API
- A [Postman collection](F4W%20Developers%20Workshop%20-%20APIC.postman_collection.json) that you can use to quickly interact with the API. 
- Work in progress in [aquaculture](aquac) and [apiculture](apic) data models

## Notes on the use of the Postman collection

The Postman collection requires some environment variables to be set up beforehand.

You will find a [sample file](F4W%20Developers%20Workshop%20-%20APIC%20-%20Stellio%20Integration.postman_environment.json) that you can import to quickly get up and running.

Please note that the API requires all calls to be authenticated. So before being able to use it, contact us and we will generate you a client id and secret. You will then have to fill them in the collection environment.
